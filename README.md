# Multiplanetary Homestead Manifesto

## Preamble

The purpose of this manifesto is to establish a core set of principles to guide the development of fundamental tools needed to construct self-sufficient (space-faring) permaculture homesteads (eco-homes or eco-villages) as a means to reduce supplychain dependencies, eliminate artificial scarcity of essential needs, and enable a post-scarcity economy.

## Principles of a Solarpunk Multiplanetary Homestead
