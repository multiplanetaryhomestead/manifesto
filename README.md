# Multiplanetary Homestead Manifesto

## Preamble

The purpose of this manifesto is to establish a set of principles to guide the development of life-support systems and tools for small-scale permaculture homesteads with enough bootstrapping capability to reduce supplychain dependencies, eliminate artificial scarcity of essential needs, and enable a post-scarcity economy, while preserving biodiversity and regenerating ecosystems.

## Principles of a Solarpunk Homestead

- regenerative (over non-regenerative) resource extraction<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
- circular (over linear) product lifecycle<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
- localized/distributed (over centralized) production<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

### Derived Principles

- recursively free and open-source (over proprietary and close-source) design and manufacturing of critical life-support systems<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup><sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

### Permaculture Ethics

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: Earth-care
