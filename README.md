# Multiplanetary Homestead Manifesto

## Preamble

The purpose of this manifesto is to establish a set of principles to guide the development of life-support systems and tools for small-scale intensive permaculture homesteads with enough bootstrapping capability to reduce supplychain dependencies, eliminate artificial scarcity of essential needs, and enable a post-scarcity economy, while preserving biodiversity and regenerating ecosystems.

## Principles of a Solarpunk Multiplanetary Homestead

- regenerative (over non-regenerative) resource extraction<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
